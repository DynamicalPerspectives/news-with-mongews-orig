# news-with-mongews-orig
I SUBMITTED THIS as my original project. I couldn't get it deployed on Heroku, so I deployed the solution to Heroku successfully and tried to recreate the steps in my original project, but couldn't get it to work again, even on my localhost with own db. (I also created another heroku app and mongoLab). FWIW I have uploaded a screengrab of the "app" I created that shows articles from Jezebel.com with links and the ability to click on the link to read and then click on a note to save or delete.
